#Title:
The outlier detection method GNDIWD

#Aim:

We propose a novel outlier detection algorithm (called GNDIWD) based on granular neighborhood discrimination index and weighted distance.

#About Dataset:

In the experiments, 15 datasets were used to evaluate the performance of our algorithm. The 15 datasets include 5 datasets from the ODDS repository [1] and 10 datasets from the UCI repository [2-3].
